Introduction
============

The 'Attachments' extension for Joomla! allows files to be uploaded and
attached to articles, categories, or other types of content. The 'Attachments'
extension includes a plugin to display the attachments and a component for
uploading and managing attachments, as well as other plugins. There are
options to control who can see the attachments and who can upload them, along
with several many options to increase its flexibility and usefulness. Note:
all options are controlled through the component manager.

.. warning:: This version of the *Attachments* extension only works for
             Joomla! 1.7, 2.5 or greater. 

.. note:: In the rest of this document, the term **content item** is sometimes
   used.  Normally we think of attaching files to articles.  Attachments supports
   attaching files and URLs to articles or categories by default.  But it is
   possible to attach to other types of content types (this requires special
   'Attachments' plugins).  All of these are referred to as **content items**.

The 'Attachments' extension has been translated into many different
languages.  Please see the `Translations`_ section for the list of
available translations.  Most of these languages packs are in the process
of being updated for 'Attachments' version 3.0.

New features in Version 3.0
===========================

* Full support for the new ACL/permissions system of Joomla 1.7/2.5+.  This
  gives you significant flexibility to control who can create, edit, or delete
  attachments.  See the `Attachments Permissions`_ section for more details.

* Full support for viewing access levels.  This means you can set some of your
  attachments to be visible by anyone, and some to be visible only to users
  in certain groups (as defined by the Access Levels).   
  See the `Access Levels Visibility Control`_ section for more details.

* Simplified and improved options for hiding attachments in various contexts.


Major features of the Attachments Extension
===========================================

* You can manage attachments from the article editor, including adding,
  editing, and deleting attachments.
* You can create attachments while an article is being created.
* All attachments lists on the front end are updated by Ajax and do not
  require full page reloads.
* You can "attach" URLs as well as files to content items.
* You can show the attachments list anywhere in an article (or content item).
* In the administrative back end:
     - There are options to filter the listed attachments to unpublished
       or trashed articles or content items.
     - Filtering of the list of articles
     - Sorting the list of attachments by any of the column headers.
     - Useful administrative utility commands
* The Attachments extension supports "Attachments plugins".  These plugins allow
  attaching files to any content item that invokes the ``onPrepareContent``
  plugin.  For example, you can attach files to Category descriptions.  
  With a bit of work, an extension developer can create a new 'Attachments'
  plugin to support adding attachments to things like CB personal info
  displays, Virtuemart product descriptions, etc.  See section 
  `What Can Files Be Attached To?`_ for more details.

Uploading Restrictions
======================

Not all types of attachment files can be uploaded.  The 'Attachments'
extension will not allow uploading of files that are not permitted by the
Joomla! Media Manager.  To see (or change) what file types are allowed, go to
the **Media manager** item under the **Content** menu.  Click on the
**Options** button on the toolbar and select the *Component* tab.  There you
will see the options for controlling what types of file extensions and mime
types are permitted for uploads. The 'Attachments' extension respects these
limitations.  However, the restriction on 'Legal Extensions (File
Types)' is ignored.  Add extensions for any file type that you require in the
"Legal Extensions (File Types)" field.  You may also add appropriate MIME
types in the "Legal MIME Types" field.

.. warning::  If you add items to the "Legal Extensions" or "Legal MIME Types"
              fields, do not add any spaces!


Attachments Settings
====================

All of the settings for 'Attachments' are controlled via the
component manager. To access these settings, go to the administrative
back end and select "Attachments" under the "Component" menu.  Click
on the "Options" button on the right end of the tool bar and you will see
options grouped under several tabs.

Basic Options
-------------

.. image:: images/options-basic.png
   :class: float-right
   :alt: Basic Options

* **Attachments published by default:** This 'auto publish' feature controls
  whether new attachments are published by default when they are added. If
  'Yes' is selected, when attachments are added, they will published
  immediately and will be visible to users. If 'No' is selected, new
  attachments will not be published by default.  An administrator or someone
  with appropriate permissions will need to publish them from the
  administrative back end before the attachments will be available.

* **Auto Publish Warning:** If the auto-publish option is
  disabled (see previous option), you may wish to inform those adding
  attachments how they can get their attachment published. You can insert an
  appropriate message here.  If this field is empty, a general system message
  will be added suggesting that they contact their system administrator to
  any newly uploaded attachments published.

* **Default Access Level:** The default access level for new attachments.
  Each attachment has an 'access level' which controls who can see or
  download that attachment.  When an attachment is created, its access level
  is set to this default value initially (if the attachment creator is in
  appropriate groups).  A site administrator or someone with appropriate
  permissions may change the attachment's access level to control who can
  see that specific attachments.

* **Name for user-defined field 1-3:** If you have some
  additional information about each attachment that you wish to add, the
  'Attachments' extension allows you to defined up to three optional user-defined
  fields.  To create a new field, insert the name for it in one of the three
  entries.  Clear the name to disable the display and editing of this field.
  The user-defined fields will be shown in the order listed here.  The maximum
  length of each user-defined field name is 40 characters.  The data in these
  fields may be up to 100 characters long.

  .. hint:: If you add an asterisk to the end of a user-defined field name, it
     will not be displayed on the front end.  It will be visible when an
     attachment is edited on the front end and always visible in the back
     end.  This hidden user-defined field can be used to order attachments in
     an arbitrary order by putting integer values in the field.

* **Maximum filename or URL length:**
  The maximum filename or URL length for attachments list.  Filenames or URLs
  longer than this will be truncated and put into the display name (for
  display purposes only, the actual filename or URL will not be changed).  A
  value of 0 means the filename length is unlimited by this option (the
  display_name field in the attachments database table is limited to 80
  characters).  Note: If display filenames or URLs are truncated by this option, 
  the truncated name will be inserted into the "Display Filename / URL" field.
  This option only affects attachments added after this option is set.

* **Where should attachments be placed?** This option controls
  the location in the article (or content item) the list of attachments will be placed.
  This option applies to all attachments lists:

     - '*At the beginning*'
     - '*At the end*'
     - '*Custom placement*' - With this option, the attachments list will
       appear in the article (or content item) where ever the special tag:
       {attachments} occurs.

       .. warning:: In custom placement mode, any article (or content item)
          that does not include this tag will display its the attachments list
          at its end.

       In this mode, when editing an article in the back
       end, an extra button will be displayed: [Insert {attachments} token].
       Position the cursor where you want the custom placement token and use
       this button to insert the token.  This button will add surrounding HTML
       tags to hide the token when it is not replaced (for example when the
       attachments list is not supposed to be visible).  In HTML, the token
       looks like this with the surrounding tags to hide it::

         <span class="hide">{attachments}</span>

       In the back end editors, you will see the {attachments} tag but not the
       HTML 'span' tags unless you switch to HTML mode.  In the front end, you
       will never see the {attachments} tag unless the insert_attachments_tag
       plugin is disabled.  If you wish to remove the {attachments} token, you
       may want to use the "HTML" view mode in the editor to make sure that
       you also delete the surrounding span tags.

       .. warning:: The custom placement mode does not work for attachments on
                    Category descriptions.

     - '*Disabled (filter)*' - This option will disable the display of
       attachments lists and suppress the display of any {attachments}
       tags in articles or content items.
     - '*Disabled (no filter)*' - This option will disable the display of
       attachments lists and will not suppress the display of any
       {attachments} tags in articles (or content items).

* **Allow frontend editing of the access level:**
  Allow setting the access level for an attachment from the front end when
  editing an attachment or creating a new attachment.  The 'access level'
  controls which groups may view (or access) the attachment. Note that the no
  one editing an attachment will ever be able to set the access level for it
  to a level for which they are not authorized.


Formatting Options
------------------

.. image:: images/options-formatting.png
   :class: float-right
   :alt: Formatting Options

* **Show titles:** If set to 'Yes', a row of titles will be
  added above the list of attachments describing what is in each column.

* **Show attachment description:** This setting controls
  whether the attachment description is shown in the list of attachments.

* **Show attachment creator:** Show the username of the
  one who created (uploaded) the attachment.

* **Show file size:** This setting controls
  whether the attachment file size is shown in the list of attachments.

* **Show number of downloads:** This setting controls
  whether the number of downloads is shown in the list of attachments.

  .. warning:: This option only works for file attachments in secure mode!
     In non-secure mode, files are maintained as static files and accessed
     directly, without going through Joomla! code.  Therefore it is impossible
     to update the number of downloads for a file when it is accessed this way.
     So the display of the number of file downloads will only work in secure mode
     when this option is set to 'Yes'.

* **Show file modification date:** If this setting
  is 'Yes', the modification date for the file will be added to the
  attachment list for articles that have attachments. If 'No' is
  selected, no date will be added to the attachment list.

* **Format string for modification date:** 
  You may select the format for the displayed creation and modification dates
  by giving a format string like ones used by the Joomla `JDate::format()`
  function (which is based on the PHP dateformat function).  Search the web
  with 'PHP date' for examples.  Note that JDate handles translation of
  month/day names as necessary.  The default format string (Y-m-d H:M) gives
  dates with 24-hour time like 2013-01-05 16:21.  To remove the time-of-day
  part, leave out the 'H:M' part.

* **Attachments list order:** This option allows you to specify the order in
  which attachments will be listed in the attachments lists.  Most of the
  options are self-explanatory:

  1.  '*Filename*' - If this option is selected, the attachments will be
      sorted alphabetically by the filename.
  2.  '*File size(smallest first)*'
  3.  '*File size(largest first)*'
  4.  '*Description*'
  5.  '*Display filename or URL*' - All attachments that have blank
      display filenames will appear before the ones with display filenames and
      will be sorted by their filenames.
  6.  '*Creator*' - Sort by the name of the user who uploaded the attachment.
  7.  '*Creation date (oldest first)*'
  8.  '*Creation date (newest first)*'
  9.  '*Modification date (oldest first)*'
  10. '*Modification date (newest first)*'
  11. '*Attachment ID*' - If this option is selected, the
      attachments will be sorted by the attachment ID.  This has the effect of
      ordering the attachments in the order they were created.
  12. '*User-defined field 1*'
  13. '*User-defined field 2*'
  14. '*User-defined field 3*'


Visibility Options
------------------

These options control when attachments will be visible on the front page,
assuming the user is in the appropriate groups to see the attachments.

.. image:: images/options-visibility.png
   :class: float-right
   :alt: Visibility Options

* **Hide attachments on the front page:** Select this option to prevent any
  attachments from being shown on the front page of your website.

* **Hide attachments before 'Read More' breaks:** Select this option to
  prevent attachments from being displayed on the the front end if they are
  before 'Read More' breaks in articles.  If you click on the link to read the
  full article, the attachments will be shown.

* **Hide attachments on blog pages:** Select this option to prevent
  attachments from being shown on any page with 'blog' layouts.

* **Hide attachments except on article views:** Select this option to prevent
  attachments from being shown on any page on the front page except for 
  views for single specific articles.

* **Always show attachments on category views:** Select this option to always
  show attachments on category views -- regardless of other options.

* **Hide attachments for categories:** Hide attachments on any category views
  for the selected categories.  Note that attachments will be displayed for
  children categories unless they are explicitly selected.

.. class:: small-figure

.. figure:: images/options-hide-categories.png
   :alt: Hide Categories Selection

   To select or deselect categories without affecting other categories, hold
   the Control-key when mouse-clicking on the category.  In the figure, only
   one category is selected.


* **Hide 'Add Attachments' link:** Always hide the 'Add Attachments' link on
  the front page.  This requires attachments to be added to articles, etc,
  by editing them in the front page (where an 'Add Attachments' button will
  be available under the editing area).

Advanced Options
----------------

.. image:: images/options-advanced.png
   :class: float-right
   :alt: Advanced Options

* **Characters forbidden in uploaded filenames:** Filenames containing these
  characters will not be allowed to be uploaded.  These characters are
  problematic in the URL presented to the user for file attachments in
  'non-secure' mode so they are forbidden.  These characters are generally not
  an issue when using 'secure' mode since the filename is not used as part of
  the URL presented to the user.

* **CSS style for attachments tables:** To override the CSS
  styling of attachments lists, specify your own style name here.  The default
  style name is 'attachmentsList'.  See  the section `CSS Styling of Attachment Lists`_.

* **File link open mode:**
  This mode how the links to attachment files will be opened.  'In same window'
  means the file will be opened in the same browser window.  'In new window'
  means the file will be opened in a new window.  In some browsers, using the
  'In new window' option will actually open the attachment in a new tab.

* **Custom titles for attachments lists:** By default, the 'Attachments'
  extension inserts the title "Attachments:" above the list of attachments for
  each article or content item (if it has attachments). In some cases, you may
  prefer using some other term for specific articles or content items.  You may
  specify the exact term you would like to use on an item-by-item basis. For
  example, if you would like article 211 to use the custom title "Downloads:",
  then add this to this setting: '211 Downloads' (without the quotes). Use one
  entry per line.  For other types of content items, use the form:
  'category:23 This is the title for category 23' where 'category' can be
  replaced by the name of the content item entity.  The example for articles
  above could have been done with 'article:211 Downloads'.  Note that an entry
  without a numeric ID at the beginning will be applied to all content items.
  So it is good practice to put such global overrides first in the list and
  then override the item-by-item custom titles afterward.

  .. note::
     If you wish to change the titles used for attachments lists globally, you
     may copy the translations entry 'ATTACH_ATTACHMENTS_TITLE' from the
     translation file::

	 content/attachments/language/qq-QQ/qq-QQ.plg_content_attachments.ini

     into the global override file::

         language/overrides/en-GB.override.ini

     where qq-QQ refers to the language designator code such as en-GB for
     English.  (If you are not familiar with Joomla! translation files, find
     the line that has 'ATTACH_ATTACHMENTS_TITLE' on left side of the '=' sign
     and the translation on the right in double-quotes.  Edit anything to the
     right of the '=' sign.  Do not change anything to the left of the '='
     sign.).  The reason to put your translation modifications into the global
     override file is because the first translation file listed above is part
     of the Attachments extension and will be updated if the Attachments
     extensions is upgraded (meaning that any changes you do to it will be
     lost).

* **Timeout for checking links:**
  Timeout for checking links (seconds).  Whenever a link is added as an
  attachment, the link is checked directly (you can disable this check in the
  form).  If the link can be accessed before the timeout, the file size and
  other information about the link is retrieved.  If not, generic information
  is used.  To disable the check, enter 0.

* **Superimpose URL link icons:**
  Superimpose URL link icons over the file attachment icon for each
  attachment to indicate it is a URL.  Valid URLs are shown with arrows and
  invalid URLs are shown with a red line across the file type icon (bottom
  left to top right).

* **Suppress obsolete attachments (in back end):**
  Set the default for suppressing *obsolete* attachments in the administrative
  back end.  In this context, *obsolete* attachments are ones attached to
  unpublished or trashed parents. You can override this using the 'Show
  attachments for' drop-down menu on the right just above the list of
  attachments (on the same line as the filter).  When you use the drop-down
  menu to control which attachments are visible, the system remembers that
  setting until you log out as administrator.  So changing this parameter may
  not seem to have an effect.  This parameter setting will come into effect
  the next time you log in as administrator.



Security Options
----------------

.. image:: images/options-security.png
   :class: float-right
   :alt: Security Options

* **Secure attachment downloads:**
  By default, the 'Attachments' extension saves attachment files in a publicly
  accessible sub-directory.  If you choose the *secure* option, the directory
  in which the attachments are saved will be made publicly inaccessible.  The
  download links for the attachments in the front end will download the
  attachment files but will not be direct links.  This will prevent access
  unless users have appropriate permissions.  If *secure* downloads are not
  selected, the links to the attachments will be shown as the options above
  indicate, but the files will still be accessible to anyone if they know the
  full URL, since the sub-directory is public.  

  The *secure* option prevents access to uploaded files to users without
  appropriate permissions even if they know the full URL, since this option
  prevents public access to the attachments sub-directory.  For URL
  'attachments', the 'display name' for the URL is shown but not the full URL.
  When a user with appropriate permissions tries to access a URL attachment,
  they will be redirected to the desired URL.  So for URL 'attachments', the
  display name must be set if the actual URL is not to be exposed.

  In *secure* mode, any attachment set to the 'Public' access level can be
  seen and downloaded by anyone.

  .. hint::

     If you have problems with filenames with Unicode characters, you should
     enable the **Secure attachment downloads** option (especially on Windows
     servers).

* **Download mode for secure downloads:**
  This option controls whether files should be downloaded as separate files or
  displayed in the browser (if the browser can handle that type of file).
  There are two options:

     - *'inline'* - In this mode, files that can be displayed by the browser
	 will be displayed in the browser (such as text files and images).

     - *'attachment'* - With the 'attachment' mode, files will always be
	 downloaded as separate files.

  In either case, files that can't be displayed in the browser will be
  downloaded as external files.


Permissions Options
-------------------

The permissions options are explained in the following `Attachments Permissions`_ section.


Attachments Permissions
=======================

The attachments extension takes full advantage of the new Joomla!
ACL/permissions system introduced in Joomla! 1.6.  This gives websites that
use Attachments much more flexibility to control who can create, edit, delete
and manage attachments.

Before describing the ACL permissions related to Attachments, it is important
to understand a key underlying principle:

.. important::

   All attachments are attached to a parent article, category, or other
   content item.  Creating, editing, deleting, or changing the state of an
   attachment is considered to be a form of editing the parent content
   item. So the user must first have permission to edit the parent content item
   before any Attachments-specific permissions are checked.

To change the permissions for various user groups, go to the administrative
back end and select "Attachments" under the "Component" menu.  Click
on the "Options" button on the right end of the tool bar and then select the
permissions tab. You will see this:

.. figure:: images/options-permissions.png
   :alt: Permission Options

   The attachments permissions options.  The permissions for the Public group
   are shown.

Here is a brief description of permissions related to Attachments that are available:

.. class:: permissions

Default Permissions
-------------------

When the attachments extension is installed, it installs these basic permissions:

.. class:: hide-title

.. important:: **Basic Behavior Of Default Permissions**

     * Authors (and Managers) or above can add attachments to any article/parent they can edit

     * Authors (and Managers) or above can edit or delete any attachments on any
       article/parent they can edit

     * Editors (and Managers) or above can publish/unpublish attachments from the
       front end.  

     * Authors cannot publish their own attachments.

If you want different defaults, you will need to edit the permissions using
the "Permissions" tab on the Attachments options.


Permissions Settings for Common Scenarios
-----------------------------------------

Here are some suggestions about how to set the permissions to achieve the
desired behaviors:

  * **Scenario 1 - Authors can publish their own Attachments**

     - In the permissions options, click on the 'Author' entry.  Locate the 
       'Edit State of Own Attachments' line and set it to 'Allowed' and click on
       'Save' to verify the changes.

          :alt: Permissions setting for scenario1

  * **Scenario 2 - Authors can edit/delete their own attachments but no one else's**

     - In the permissions options, click on the 'Author' entry.  Locate the 
       'Edit State Of Attachments For Owned Article/Parent' and
       'Delete Attachments For Owned Article/Parent' and set them both to 'Denied'.
       Click on 'Save' to verify the changes
       
       .. figure:: images/permissions-scenario2.png
          :alt: Permissions setting for scenario2

       Since Author still has permissions to edit/delete their own attachments
       this effectively prevents them from editing/deleting attachments that
       they did not create, even if they can edit the article.

       Note that all user groups derived from Author (e.g., Editor, Publisher,
       etc) will also be denied from editing or deleting attachments for
       articles/parents that they did not create (from this permission).
       Fortunately, they generally have the higher level permissions 'Edit
       Attachments' and 'Delete Attachments' which means they can edit or
       delete any attachments on any article that they can edit (assuming
       their permissions have not been changed).

If you have other common scenarios that you feel should be documented, please
feel free to contact me so I can update this documentation (see the end of
this page for contact information).

Other Notes on Permissions
--------------------------

  * If a user has permissions to edit the state of their attachments, they
    will see the 'Publish: Yes/No' options on forms to add or edit
    attachments.  If they select 'No' and save the attachment, the attachment
    will still be visible to them in the front end (while they are logged in).
    No one else will see the unpublished attachments on the front end.  If the
    user wants to change the Published state, they can edit the attachment
    (even though it is grayed out) and change the states.

Access Levels Visibility Control
================================

The Attachments extension now supports the Joomla 'Access Levels'.  Each
attachment can be assigned to specific access levels such as 'Public',
'Registered', and 'Special', as well as any other access levels created on
your site.   The two basic levels are:

 * **'Public'** - Anyone visiting the website will be able to see and download
   attachments with 'access level' set to 'Public' if the article/parent is
   visible and no other Attachments visibility settings prevent the
   attachments from being shown.

 * **'Registered'** - Anyone that is logged into the website will be able to
   see and download attachments with 'access level' set to 'Registered' if the
   article/parent is visible and no other Attachments visibility settings
   prevent the attachments from being shown.

The effect of other access levels depends on the groups associated with the
access level.

The ability to set the 'Access Level' for individual attachments gives
extensive control on who is able to see and download attachments.

.. note:: 

   Suppose you create a new access level on your site.  Users that are not
   explicitly members of the groups associated with the new access level will
   not be able to set their attachments for that access level.  If you edit an
   attachment as the Super User, you might be surprised that the new access
   level does not show up in the access level options.  There are two
   potential issues.  (1) If you have just created the new access level, you
   may need to log out of the back end and log in again for the changes to be
   completely visible.  (2) The other reason is that the user (Super User, for
   instance) is not in the access level.  The fix is simple, make sure the
   user is in one of the groups associated with the new access level.


Display Filename or URL
=======================

Normally, when files are uploaded (or URLs are installed) and listed in a list
of attachments, the full filename (or URL) is shown as a link to download the
attachment.  In some cases, the filename (or URL) may be too long for this to
work nicely.  In the upload form, there is another field called "Display
Filename or URL" in which the person uploading the file can insert an
alternative filename (or URL) or label to display instead of the full filename
(or URL).  For instance, some abbreviation of the filename could be added in
this field.  The field may be edited in the administrative back end when
attachments are edited.  Note: There is an option called "Maximum Filename or
URL Length" in the 'Attachments' extension options.  It can be set to automatically
truncate uploaded displayed filenames; the resulting truncated filename will
be inserted into the "Display Filename or URL" field.

Attaching URLs
==============

Besides files, 'Attachments' version 3.0 has is the ability to "attach" URLs
to content items.  When you bring up one of the "Add attachment" dialog boxes,
you will see a button labeled as "Enter URL instead".  If you click on it you
will get an entry field for the URL and see two options:

* **Verify URL existence?** - In order to determine the file type of the
    URL (to pick a suitable icon), the code queries the server for basic
    information about the file including the file type and size.  In some
    cases, the server will not respond to these requests even though the
    URL is valid.  By default, Attachment will not accept URLs that have
    not been validated by the server.  But if you know the URL is valid,
    you can uncheck this option and force the 'Attachments' extension to
    take the URL--but there are no guarantees the file type or file size
    will be correct.  Note that the server will be queried whether or not
    this option is selected.

* **Relative URL?** - Normally you will enter URLs prefixed with 'http...' to
    indicate an full website URL.  If you wish to point to files/commands
    relative to your Joomla installation, use the 'relative' option.

The URLs are shown with the file-type icon and overlaid with an arrow
(indicating that it is a good link) or an red diagonal slash (indicating that
it could not be validated).  When you edit a URL, you can change whether the
link is valid or not to get the overlay you wish.  Also note that URL overlays
can be disabled entirely using the main **Superimpose URL link icons**
parameter.  There are several useful commands relating to URLs (and files) in
the "Utilities" command in the back end.

What Can Files Be Attached To?
==============================

Besides attaching files or URLs to articles, it is possible to
attach files or URLs to other types of content items such as 
Categories (see below).  If appropriate 'Attachments' plugins are
installed, it may be possible to attach files or URLs to a wide variety
of content items such as user profiles, shopping cart product
descriptions, etc.  Basically any content item that is displayed on the
front end and uses the content event ``'onPrepareContent'`` can host
attachments (if a suitable 'Attachments' plugin is installed).  Content
items that invoke content events are typically items that have content
to be displayed (such as articles) or have descriptions that will be
displayed.

Attaching Files or URLs to Category Descriptions
------------------------------------------------

With this version of attachments, users can attach files to Category
descriptions.  These descriptions are generally only visible on Category Blog
pages.  Attachments may be added to Category descriptions in the Category
editor.

.. warning:: Attachments for categories will only show the category basic
   parameter 'description' is set to *Show* (via the Menu Editor) AND the
   category description is not empty.

If you wish to learn more about how to develop a new Attachment plugin, there
is a manual that is available as part of this 'Attachments' installation:

* `Attachments Plugin Creation Manual
  <plugin_manual/html/index.html>`_


.. warning:: 

   The Attachment Plugin Creation Manual has not been updated for Attachments
   3.0 yet.  There have been some architectural changes that means that
   Attachments plugins in Joomla 1.7/2.5+ will have some significant
   differences from those for Joomla 1.5.


CSS Styling of Attachment Lists
===============================

The lists of attachments on the front end are done using a special
'div' that contains a table for the attachments. The table has
several different CSS classes associated with it to allow the website
developer the flexibility to customize the appearance of the table. Look in
the attachments plugin file CSS file (in plugins/content/attachments.css) for
examples. If you wish to change the style, consider copying the original
styles into the end of the same file and renaming 'attachmentsList' in the
copied section to something of your choice.  Edit the 'Attachments' parameter
(in the  component manager) and change the parameter *attachments table style*
to the new class name. Then modify the class definitions in your copied section
appropriately. This approach will allow you to quickly revert to the original
style by changing the plugin parameter *attachments table style* back to
its default, 'attachmentsList'. This also has the advantage that the
section of modified styles can be copied to a file and easily brought back in
when the version of 'Attachments' is upgraded. This could also be done via a
CSS @import command.

File Type Icons
===============

The 'Attachments' extension adds an icon in front of each attachment in the
list of attachments. If you wish to add a new icon type, follow these steps:

1. Add an appropriate icon in the directory 'media/attachments/icons', if an
   appropriate icon is not already there;

2. Edit the file 'components/com_attachments/file_types.php' and add an
   appropriate line to the static array $attachments_icon_from_file_extension
   which maps a file extension to an icon name (all in the
   media/attachments/icons directory). If this does not work, you may need to
   add an appropriate line to the array $attachments_icon_from_mime_type.

3. Don't forget to make copies of the icon file and the updated file_types.php
   to some directory outside of the website directories before upgrading the
   version of 'Attachments' in the future.

Administrative Utility Commands
===============================

There are several utility commands in the back end that are available for
Administrators.   These include:

* **Disable uninstallation of MySQL Attachments Table:** Normally, when the
  Attachments extension is uninstalled, the database table is deleted that
  contains information about the attachments.   If you wish to retain this
  data when uninstalling Attachments, execute this command.  After you
  uninstall Attachments the attachments table will remain.

* **Reinstall Default Asset Rules or Attachments Permissions:** When the
  Attachments extension is installed, the installer adds several default asset
  rules so that the custom permissions added in the Attachments extension
  behave logically and similarly to the standard permissions.  If you
  reinstall or update Joomla, these asset rules may be lost.  You can restore
  them by executing this command.

* **Regenerate attachment system filenames:** This command is very useful when
  you move (migrate) your attachments from one computer to another.  The full
  path each file attachment is kept in the database and called the "system
  filename".  If you move attachments from one system to another, it is very
  likely this path information will be incorrect.  You may execute this
  command to regenerate all of the system filenames for all file attachments.

  The Utility command to "Regenerate system filenames" works for migration
  from windows to Linux servers.  It also works for migration from Linux to
  Windows servers with a couple of potential problems:

     - When you copy your files to your Windows server, you need to verify
       that the attachments directory (usually 'attachments') and all files
       within it are writable by the Joomla web server.

     - You may have problems porting files that have Unicode characters in
       their filenames because the archiving/unarchiving software has problems
       with the Unicode filenames (on the Windows side).  You may need to save
       those files, delete the corresponding attachments, and then re-attach
       them.


* **Remove spaces from filenames:** You may execute this command to replace
  all spaces with underscores in the filename for all file attachments.  This
  may be necessary on some systems.  In 'Secure' mode, this should not be
  necessary.

* **Update attachment file sizes:** This command will recompute the file
  sizes for all file attachments.

* **Check existence of attachment files:** This command may be used to verify
  that the file exists for all file attachments.  Missing files will be
  listed.

* **Validate URLs:** The URL attachments retain information about the validity
  of the URL given.  This command will check each URL attachment and check the
  validity of the URL and update the validity information for the attachment.

.. note:: 

   In the back end, sometimes when you execute one of the Utility commands, you
   may get a warning that the browser needs to resend the request.  This is
   harmless, so click [OK] and the command will execute.


Warnings
========

* **If you have attachment files that are sensitive or private, use the
  *Secure attachment downloads* option!** If you do not use the secure option,
  the attachment files are saved in a public sub-directory and are accessible
  to anyone that knows the full URL.  The *secure* option prevents access by
  anyone that does not have appropriate permissions (as determined by the
  options above).  See the discussion of the *Secure attachment downloads*
  option above for more detail.

* Every time a file is uploaded, the existence of the upload sub-directory is
  checked and it will be created if if it does not exist.  By default the
  sub-directory for uploaded files is 'attachments' in the root directory of
  your web site files.  The name of the sub-directory can be changed using the
  'Sub-directory for uploads' option. If the 'Attachments' extension is unable
  to create the sub-directory for uploads, you must create it yourself (and you
  may have problems uploading files).  Make sure to give the sub-directory
  suitable permissions for uploading files.  In the Unix/Linux world, that is
  probably something like 775.  Note the process of creating the upload
  sub-directory may fail if the top level directory of your website has
  permissions that prevent the web server (and PHP) from creating
  sub-directories.  You may need to loosen the permissions temporarily to allow
  the sub-directory to be created by uploading attachments.

* If this extension does not permit you to upload specific types of files
  (such as zip files), be aware that the extension respects the restrictions
  placed by the Media Manager on types of files permitted to be uploaded. This
  is to prevent uploading of potentially harmful types of files such as html
  or php files. The administrator can update the Media Manager settings to add
  specific file types by going to the "Global Settings" item under the "Site"
  menu, selecting the "System" tab, and added the appropriate file extension
  in lower and upper case and Mime type to the lists under the "Media Manager"
  section.

* If you cannot see the attachments in the front end, there are several
  possible reasons:

     - The attachment is not published.  You can change this in Attachments
       manager page in the back end.
     - The parent article or content item is not published.
     - The attachment access level is set to 'Registered' and you are
       not logged in on the front end.
     - The 'Content - Attachments' plugin is not enabled.  Use the plugin manager
       to enable it.
     - In the 'Content - Attachments' (via the plugin manager), the access
       level is not set to 'Public'.
     - If your site uses caching, try clearing the caches and refreshing the
       page.
     - If you not seeing attachments for a category in a category blog view
       and you are using a custom template, it may be necessary to make a
       small modification to the template in order to see the category
       attachments.  Feel free to contact the author for help with this
       issue (see the contact info at the bottom of this page).

* If you encounter limits on the sizes of files that you attempt to upload,
  try adding the following lines to the .htaccess file in the root of
  your Joomla! website::

     php_value upload_max_filesize 32M
     php_value post_max_size 32M

  where you may change the 32M (megabytes) value to whatever you wish as the maximum
  upload file size.

* 'Attachments' now supports "attaching" URLs to content items.  If your server
  is Windows Vista and you encounter problems attaching URLs that involve
  ``localhost``, this is a known problem related to IPv4 and IPv6 conflicts.
  To fix it, edit the file::

       C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

  Comment out the line that has ``::1`` on it.  Note that ``hosts`` is a
  hidden system file and you may need to modify your folder options to show
  hidden files to see and edit it.

* If you have difficulties attaching files that have Unicode characters (such
  as Russian/Cyrillic characters), set the *Secure Attachments Downloads*
  option to 'Yes'.  Filenames with Unicode characters should work properly on
  Linux servers in secure or non-secure modes, but do not always work
  correctly on Windows servers in non-secure mode.

* 'Attachments' now supports attaching files to articles while they are being
  created in the Article editor.  There is one limitation to this.  New
  attachments are in a state of "limbo" after the file is uploaded and before
  the article is actually saved for the first time.  During this (hopefully
  brief) limbo period, the new attachments are identified by user id only.  So
  if more than one person is using the same user account and they create
  articles at the same time and add attachments at the same time, there is no
  guarantee that the attached files will end up with the correct article.

* There is a 'Help' forum and a 'Frequently Asked Questions' forum for the
  'Attachments' 3 extension that is hosted on the joomlacode.org website.  If
  you encounter a problem that is not covered in this help page, please
  consult the forums.  (Please post questions on the 'Help' form.  I will post
  commonly asked questions on the 'Frequently Asked Questions'):

     - `Attachments Forums at
       http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/attachments3/forum/
       <http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/attachments3/forum/>`_


Upgrading
=========

Upgrading is very easy.  You have two choices:

1. Simply install the new version of 'Attachments'. There is no need to
   uninstall the previous version.  You do not need to do anything to retain
   your old attachments.  Simply install the new version and it will update
   everything appropriately.

2. PREFERRED: One of the excellent new features in Joomla 1.6 and later is
   the extension updater.  Go to the Extension Manager in the back end and
   click on the 'Update' tab.  Click 'Purge Cache' and then 'Find Updates' on
   the toolbar.  If there is a new release of Attachments, it will be shown.
   You can select the release and then click on the 'Update' button on the
   toolbar to install the new release.  This makes keeping the Attachments
   extension updated very simple!


Uninstalling
============

* To uninstall the Attachments extension, go to the 'Manage' tab on the
  Extension Manager page (under the 'Extensions' menu).  **Select ONLY the item**::

     Package: Attachments for Joomla 1.7/2.5+

  and click on the 'Uninstall' button on the toolbar.  This will uninstall the
  attachments component and all the associated plugins.

* If you wish to retain your attachments, make a copy of the 'attachments'
  directory at the top of the Joomla installation and copy the '_attachments'
  table in the database.  If you intend to reinstall soon, see the **Disable
  uninstallation of MySQL Attachments Table** command in the `Administrative
  Utility Commands`_ to prevent the attachments database table from being
  deleted on uninstallation of the Attachments extension.
 
* If you do not wish to keep existing attachments, delete them all first (in
  the administrative back end).  Once you have uninstalled the Attachments
  extension, delete the 'attachments' directory at the top of your Joomla
  installation.


Migration Attachments from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.7/2.5+
========================================================

To migrate your attachments from a Joomla 1.5 site to a Joomla 1.7/2.5 (or
later) site, follow the procedure outlined here:

 
  * `Migrating Attachments from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.7/2.5+
